  // Magnetic Declination is the correction applied according to your present location
  // in order to get True North from Magnetic North, it varies from place to place.
  // 
  // The declination for your area can be obtained from http://www.magnetic-declination.com/
  // Take the "Magnetic Declination" line that it gives you in the information, 
  //
  // Examples:
  //   Christchurch, 23째 35' EAST
  //   Wellington  , 22째 14' EAST
  //   Dunedin     , 25째 8'  EAST
  //   Auckland    , 19째 30' EAST
  //

  // The device can operate in SINGLE (default) or CONTINUOUS mode
  //   SINGLE simply means that it takes a reading when you request one
  //   CONTINUOUS means that it is always taking readings
  // for most purposes, SINGLE is what you want.
  Compass.SetSamplingMode(COMPASS_SINGLE);
  
  // The scale can be adjusted to one of several levels, you can probably leave it at the default.
  // Essentially this controls how sensitive the device is.
  //   Options are 088, 130 (default), 190, 250, 400, 470, 560, 810
  // Specify the option as COMPASS_SCALE_xxx
  // Lower values are more sensitive, higher values are less sensitive.
  // The default is probably just fine, it works for me.  If it seems very noisy
  // (jumping around), incrase the scale to a higher one.
  Compass.SetScale(COMPASS_SCALE_088);
  
  // The compass has 3 axes, but two of them must be close to parallel to the earth's surface to read it, 
  // (we do not compensate for tilt, that's a complicated thing) - just like a real compass has a floating 
  // needle you can imagine the digital compass does too.
  //
  // To allow you to mount the compass in different ways you can specify the orientation:
  //   COMPASS_HORIZONTAL_X_NORTH (default), the compass is oriented horizontally, top-side up. when pointing North the X silkscreen arrow will point North
  //   COMPASS_HORIZONTAL_Y_NORTH, top-side up, Y is the needle,when pointing North the Y silkscreen arrow will point North
  //   COMPASS_VERTICAL_X_EAST,    vertically mounted (tall) looking at the top side, when facing North the X silkscreen arrow will point East
  //   COMPASS_VERTICAL_Y_WEST,    vertically mounted (wide) looking at the top side, when facing North the Y silkscreen arrow will point West  
  Compass.SetOrientation(COMPASS_HORIZONTAL_X_NORTH);
  
}
// Our main program loop.
